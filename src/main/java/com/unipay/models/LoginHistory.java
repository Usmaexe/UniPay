/**
 * Represents a record of a user's login attempt within the system.
 * Captures essential details such as the timestamp of the login,
 * the IP address from which the attempt was made, the user agent
 * string of the client's browser or application, and whether the
 * login attempt was successful.
 *
 * <p>This entity aids in monitoring user access patterns, detecting
 * unauthorized access attempts, and auditing user authentication
 * activities.
 *
 * <p>Key Features:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>user</strong>: The user who attempted to log in. It is a relationship with the {@link User} entity.</li>
 *   <li><strong>loginTimestamp</strong>: The timestamp marking when the login attempt occurred.</li>
 *   <li><strong>ipAddress</strong>: The IP address from which the login attempt was made.</li>
 *   <li><strong>userAgent</strong>: The user agent string of the client's browser or application.</li>
 *   <li><strong>successful</strong>: A boolean flag indicating whether the login attempt was successful.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This class helps track login attempts for each user, which is crucial for:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Auditing user login activity.</li>
 *   <li>Monitoring security and detecting suspicious login attempts.</li>
 *   <li>Providing historical login data for users.</li>
 * </ul>
