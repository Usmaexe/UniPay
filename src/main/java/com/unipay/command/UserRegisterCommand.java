/**
 * Command class for user registration. This class represents the data needed to create a new user
 * in the system, including the username, email, password, profile details, and user settings.
 *
 * The class includes a `validate()` method to ensure that the data provided in these fields
 * adheres to the validation rules defined in the AssertValidation utility, and that nested profile
 * and settings data are also validated.
 *
 * The following fields are included:
 * - username: The username of the user (will be validated for format).
 * - email: The user's email (will be validated for format).
 * - password: The user's password (will be validated for strength).
 * - profile: A `ProfileCommand` object containing user's personal information like full name, phone number, etc.
 * - settings: A `UserSettingsCommand` object containing user's preferences such as language, timezone, etc.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>
 * UserRegisterCommand userRegisterCommand = new UserRegisterCommand();
 * userRegisterCommand.setUsername("john_doe");
 * userRegisterCommand.setEmail("john.doe@unipay.com");
 * userRegisterCommand.setPassword("SecurePass123!");
 * userRegisterCommand.setProfile(new ProfileCommand());
 * userRegisterCommand.setSettings(new UserSettingsCommand());
 * userRegisterCommand.validate(); // Validates the registration data.
 * </pre>

 * @see ProfileCommand
